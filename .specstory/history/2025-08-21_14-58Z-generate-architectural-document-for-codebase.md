# Generate architectural document for codebase (2025-08-21 14:58Z)

_**User**_

Act as a Senior Software Architect. Explore the current codebase. Generate a comprehensive `architectural_document.md` in Markdown format.

Ensure it covers:
-   High-level application overview and purpose 
-   Main components (frontend, backend, database, external integrations.)
-   Key data models with fields.
-   Core workflows .
-   Tech stack for frontend, backend, database.
-   All diagrams (e.g., component, data model, sequence) should use Mermaid syntax.


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll explore the codebase systematically and create a comprehensive architectural document. Let me start by understanding the project structure and its purpose.

Act as a Product Manager for our softawre , we need to define it.

Draft a comprehensive `product_requirements_document.md` for this codebase.
Refer to `@architectural_document.md` for existing system context.

Include the following sections:
-   **Feature Name:** 
-   **Problem Statement:**
-   **User Stories:**
-   **Functional Requirements:** Detailed list of what the features must do.
-   **Non-Functional Requirements:** (e.g., security, performance, accessibility)
-   **Out of Scope (for MVP):** What will NOT be included in the first version.
-   **Success Metrics:** How will we know it's successful?


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for ElectrofyneSkinAI by analyzing the existing system and defining clear product requirements. Let me first review the architectural document to understand the current system context.

I see the installation was interrupted. Let me try running the installation again, as this sometimes happens with large dependency trees on Windows due to path length limitations or permission issues.

---

```bash
npm install --no-optional
```

```

npm warn config optional Use `--omit=optional` to exclude optional dependencies, or
npm warn config `--include=optional` to include them.

I see there are permission issues and file system conflicts happening during the npm installation on Windows. This is common with complex dependency trees that have long file paths and certain Windows security restrictions. Let me try a different approach:

---

```bash
yarn --version
```

```

PS C:\Users\jacob\Downloads\electrofyne ai scan\ElectrofyneSkinAI> yarn --version
yarn : The term 'yarn' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable 
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and

try again.

```

---

Let me try a different approach. The issue seems to be related to Windows file path limitations and permissions. Let me try using npm with some flags that can help with Windows-specific issues:

---

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-optional
```

```

npm warn config optional Use `--omit=optional` to exclude optional dependencies, or
npm warn config `--include=optional` to include them.
npm warn config
npm warn config       Default value does install optional deps unless otherwise omitted.

```

---

The issue seems to be that there are remnants of the previous incomplete installation. Let me try to manually remove the node_modules directory completely and then install:

---

```bash
rmdir /s /q node_modules
```

```

Remove-Item : A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument '/q'.

   nd

```

---

I need to use PowerShell syntax instead of CMD. Let me try this:

---

```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

```
es -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Remove-Item : The system cannot find the file specified

```

---

Let me check what files are currently in the directory and try a different approach:

---

```bash
ls
```

```
PS C:\Users\jacob\Downloads\electrofyne ai scan\ElectrofyneSkinAI> ls
